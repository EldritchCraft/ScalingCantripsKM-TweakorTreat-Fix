## How to Install
- Download and install <a href="https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager">Unity Mod Manager</a> with at least version 0.25.4.0
- Setup UMM to find your Pathfinder Kingmaker install
- Download ScalingCantripsKM.zip
- Install the mod by draggin the zip file into UMM under the Mods tab 

## Uninstallation
